# MyLibrary
The repo contains some of the literature (books, papers, articles, magazines, presentations, posters and more ) that have been important and useful in diferent projects that I carried out. Some of the items in the repo are only for the sake of information. I hope my library could help some of the visitors. 

The number of items in each folder is tabulated below :)
